# WooCommerce Loyalty Plugin

## Description

A simple plugin for the WordPress/WooCommerce platform that rewards customers with points for their purchases. The plugin tracks the amount of points a customer has earned and allows them to redeem them for discounts on their purchases. The plugin adds points to a customer's account after a purchase is made and displays the total number of points on the cart and checkout pages. It also allows customers to enter the amount of points they want to redeem and automatically deducts the corresponding discount from their order. Additionally, the plugin provides an interface for the site administrator to manage customer points, including the ability to update a customer's points balance if needed.
